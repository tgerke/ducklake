# ducklake

ducklake is an R package which complements the existing toolkits in the [duckdb](https://r.duckdb.org/index.html) and [duckplyr](https://duckplyr.tidyverse.org/index.html) packages, in order to support the new [DuckLake](https://ducklake.select/docs/stable/duckdb/introduction.html) ecosystem.

## Installation

Install the development version of ducklake with

``` r
pak::pak("tgerke/ducklake")
```

## Create a local duckdb lakehouse

```{r example}
library(ducklake)

# install the ducklake extension to duckdb 
# requires that you already have DuckDB v1.3.0 or higher
install_ducklake()

# set up a temporary directory to demonstrate use
temp_dir <- tempdir()
# haha Jenny Bryan is going to set my computer on fire
setwd(temp_dir)

# create the ducklake
attach_ducklake("my_ducklake")
# show that we have ducklake files
list.files()

# create a table using the Netherlands train traffic dataset 
create_table("nl_train_stations", "https://blobs.duckdb.org/nl_stations.csv")
# show that we now have a .files directory
list.files()
# main/ is where the parquet files go
list.files("my_ducklake.ducklake.files/main/")

# connect to the ducklake
con <- duckdb::dbConnect(
  duckdb::duckdb(
    dbdir = paste0(temp_dir, "/my_ducklake.ducklake"),
    read_only = FALSE
  )
)

# list tables in the metadata store
duckdb::dbListTables(con)
```

This next section is dev/WIP! 
```{r}
library(duckplyr)

# Find the Parquet file path for our table
train_stations_path <- get_table_path("nl_train_stations", con)
train_stations_path

nl_train_stations <- read_parquet_duckdb(train_stations_path)

# row we want to edit
nl_train_stations |> filter(code == "ASB")
nl_train_stations_new <- nl_train_stations |>
  mutate(
    name_long = case_when(
      code == "ASB" ~ "Johan Cruijff ArenA",
      .default = name_long
    )
  )
nl_train_stations_new |> filter(code == "ASB")

compute_parquet(nl_train_stations_new, train_stations_path)

# it worked, but i doubt the snapshots and other ducklake infra picked this up
nl_train_stations <- read_parquet_duckdb(train_stations_path)
nl_train_stations |> filter(code == "ASB")

# check if ducklake noticed the changes
snapshots <- DBI::dbGetQuery(con, "SELECT * FROM ducklake_snapshot ORDER BY snapshot_id DESC;")
snapshots

```
