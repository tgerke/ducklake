# ducklake

ducklake is an R package which complements the existing toolkits in the
[duckdb](https://r.duckdb.org/index.html) and
[duckplyr](https://duckplyr.tidyverse.org/index.html) packages, in order
to support the new
[DuckLake](https://ducklake.select/docs/stable/duckdb/introduction.html)
ecosystem.

``` r
